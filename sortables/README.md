# Javascript Practice: SORTING

sorting an array of strings or numbers is a piece of cake, but sorting objects is much more difficult!  

## Setup

Make sure you have the latest master pulled to your computer!

```bash
git checkout master
git pull 
```

## Goal

Sort the objects in the most logical way. make sure you sort by most unique to least unique values

```javascript
function sortAnimals(a, b) {
    // your code here
    // this one is the easiest!
}

function sortFastFood(a, b) {
    // your code here
    // this one is the most difficult
}

function sortPeople(a, b) {
    // your code here
    // this one is moderately difficult
}
```

## You will need

array.sort(): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
.sort() is an array method. methods can be called on any variable of the appropriate type. 

sortThings.js - I have started a template for you, you're welcome! 

loops: you will *definitely* need to use a for() loop to sort the fast food items

## Help?
call or text whenever! 

## Finished?
push your code and ask for a review! (and then actually wait for me to review it!)

if needed/wanted I can make this even more difficult :ok:
